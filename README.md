# Additional Features

# Important Notes About My Approach:
### State Management:
I use BLOC for state management to ensure a scalable and easy-to-maintain solution. Each page that needs dynamic data updates subscribes to specific providers, making the app reactive.
### UI/UX:
I focused on a minimalist design, inspired by Material Design guidelines. The app's UI components are responsive, ensuring a good experience across various screen sizes.
